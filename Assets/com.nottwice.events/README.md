# NotTwice Events

## Description
Welcome to **NotTwice Events**, an open-source library designed allowing you to manage events in a different way than with UnityEvent, while benefiting from a certain reusability. This package is developed to be easily extensible and modifiable while maintaining a clear separation of functionalities based on the modified packages.

## Usage
The library has several event listeners which, when attached to a scriptable event, invoke a response. This allows events to be reused across scenes. The package also benefits from reactive variables and an event flow manager.

## Installation
To install this package, use the UPM package addition via Unity:
